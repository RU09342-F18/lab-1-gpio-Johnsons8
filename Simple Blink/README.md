To make this program run you must build the program in CCS and then once it builds successfully, then plug in the appropiate micro-controller and then load the .out file onto the board and the light will start blinking.

This program works by having an infinite loop that counts down on a number and every time that count reaches zero the LED is toggled on/off, whichever is opposite its last state.
