To make this program run you must build the program in CCS and then once it builds successfully, then plug in the appropiate micro-controller and then load the .out file onto the board and the light will start blinking.

This program works by having an infinite loop that waits for an input from a button and every time that button is pressed the LED is turned on, and when it is let off the LED is turned off.
